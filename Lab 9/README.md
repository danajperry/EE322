## Lab 9: YANG

First I sucessfully installed pyang and PlantUML.

Then, I copied ~/iot/lesson9/intrusiondetection.yang to ~/demo.

However, when I had to run pyang to generate intrusiondetection.yin and intrusiondetection.uml I was unable to do so. I tried for an hour researching how to run pyang on a windows shell wihtout havijng a pi or UBUNTU and after much research and trial and error I could not come to a conclusion and therefore could not run pyang.
